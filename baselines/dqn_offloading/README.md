# DQN for Task Offloading

This is a baseline implementation of the DQN algorithm for task offloading in a multi-agent system. The algorithm is implemented in the `dqn_offloading` directory.

Run the following command to train and test the DQN model:

```bash
cd airfogsim_code
python baselines/dqn_offloading/main_dqn_offloading.py
```

Further implementation will be added in the future.
