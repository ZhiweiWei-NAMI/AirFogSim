# Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) for Task Offloading

This is a baseline implementation of the MADDPG algorithm for task offloading in a multi-agent system. The MADDPG algorithm is an extension of the DDPG algorithm for multi-agent systems. The algorithm is implemented in the `maddpg_offloading` directory.
