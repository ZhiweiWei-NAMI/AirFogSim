## Implementation of MESON in Low-Altitude Vehicular Fog Computing Scenario

### Introduction

This repository contains **my implementation** of the MESON algorithm, as described in the paper "MESON: Mobility-Aware Multi-Objective Evolutionary Computation for Computation Offloading in Vehicular Fog" published in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. The paper is available at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163866).

**Disclaimer:** This is **not the original authors' implementation**. This implementation was created independently based on the algorithm description provided in the paper. While every effort has been made to ensure correctness, I cannot guarantee that it is a perfect replication of the original algorithm or that it is free of errors. **Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues or discrepancies arising from the use of this code.**

### Key Features

-   **My implementation** of MESON in the low-altitude vehicular fog computing scenario, based on the description in the referenced paper (originally in VEC, where tasks are offloaded to RSUs).
-   Functional modules of MESON, including the mobility prediction module, the task offloading module, and the priority-based scheduling module. These modules have been implemented based on my understanding of the paper.
-   Task dependency graph generation and visualization.

### Further Notes

- I have attempted to faithfully reproduce the algorithm as described in the paper. However, differences in implementation details may exist.
- I encourage users to carefully review the code and compare it with the paper's description.
- Any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions for improvement are welcome.
